Pascal Exercise

Responsiveness: The project is not yet responsive, but I set up media queries in the _mediaQueries.scss file that I would implement throughout the styles if I had more time.

Accessibility: The project allows the user to use the keyboard to tab through all the elements and open more info on images via the 'enter' key.

Google Maps: I didn't have enough time to implement the Google Maps API to show users a map of the location where the image was taken.
